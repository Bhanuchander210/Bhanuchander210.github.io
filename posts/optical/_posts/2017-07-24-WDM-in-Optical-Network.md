###### What is WDM ?
<hr>

A technology used to transmit multiple optical signals by multiplexing into an one signal. It is commonly described frequency division multiplexing while it is used in RF radio carriers.
- In Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing, Only 1550 nm Wavelength band is used.
- C band (1525 - 1565 nm) and L band (1570 - 1610 nm), These bands works well with the EDFAs.

###### WDM Components :
---

1. Transponder
2. Muxponder
3. Mux/Demux
4. OADM
5. ROADM
6. Supervisory, DCF, VOA, Amplifiers.
7. OLP
8. Transponder cum OLP
9. Muxponder cum OLP
10. Regenerator.

###### Re-generator:
---

It lies between the two MDXs to provide power to increase the travel distance of optical signals.



###### WDM - NE Types:
---

1. Terminal.
2. Dual-Terminal.
3. ILA/OLA (Inline/Optical Line Amplifier)
4. OADM
5. ROADM

###### OADM
<hr>

OADM means the Optical Add and Drop Multiplexing which is used in optical link. The major parts are,
1. FBG - Fiber Bragg Grating 
2. Circulators.
These are used for this optical operation.

###### What is the need of OEQ ?
<hr>

Optical Equalizer is used to maintain a standard power on the link where independent wavelengths are passed between two ROADM.
